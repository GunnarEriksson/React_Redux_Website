    "content":"<div class=\"green-text padding-top-20\"><p>This year (2015) Strömma and the World Wide Fund for Nature, WWF, have entered into a three-year partnership to save the Baltic Sea.</p><p>The Baltic Sea has long been challenged by pollution and overfishing over the years. Seabird populations are declining and large-scale algal blooms have become an annual feature during the summer. Not only a popular destination for tourists, the Baltic is also a key source of revenue for all nine coastal countries in the region. A healthy Baltic Sea could generate SEK 280 billion in annual added value and bring half a million jobs to the region by 2030, according to the report \"Turning adversity into opportunity: A business plan for the Baltic Sea\" produced by the Boston Consulting Group for WWF.</p></div><div><p>The partnership covers the entire Strömma Group in Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Our goal is to lead the way in the industry on sustainability issues, and to help drive and increase passengers' awareness in the importance of a healthy Baltic Sea. We will be working to improve our expertise of the Baltic Sea, supporting nature conservation projects in the region, with a view to ensuring a healthier Baltic. A further goal is to reduce our own environmental impact, by setting and following industry-leading environmental targets for limiting emissions of CO2, nitrogen and sulphur emissions, waste, recycling, ballast water and the use of non-toxic antifouling paints.</p></div><div class=\"hidden-xs hidden-sm \"><p>Read more about WWF or how you can contribute on www.wwf.org or read more on their Swedish website: WWF Sweden's initiative in the Baltic Sea Supporting local projects.<br/>In addition to the projects mentioned above, our offices in Denmark, Finland and Sweden will also be running their own local projects. In Sweden, Strömma is supporting a Swedish WWF project, \"A Living Archipelago Sea\", which is part of a number of concrete measures that are being taken to improve the marine environment. In Finland, we will support will be nature camps and courses on how to save wildlife from oil spills made available for volunteers/our passengers. The focus in Denmark will be on a number of projects with the aim to increase awareness of marine biology and environmental science.</p><p>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions<br/>What is the situation in the Baltic?<br/>The Baltic Sea region has a unique and highly sensitive environment that is being put under increasing pressure. The sea is used for everything from tourism and fishing to oil transport, wind farms and gas pipelines. Due to its sensitive, dynamic and highly inter-dependent ecosystem, the Baltic is highly susceptible to land pollution and nutrient runoff.</p><p>There are numerous threats to the Sea, with the two most serious being eutrophication and unregulated fishing. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga, for example, are seriously affected by eutrophication. Eutrophication means an increase in nutrients, primarily phosphorus and nitrogen. With around 90 million people living in the region, activities such as agriculture, industry and traffic emit large quantities of nutrients and toxins that end up in the sea – including around 800,000 tonnes of nitrogen and around 30,000 tonnes of phosphorus per year.  The quantities vary from year to year, in part depending on precipitation levels, but they have remained far too high since the 1950s.</p></div>"
