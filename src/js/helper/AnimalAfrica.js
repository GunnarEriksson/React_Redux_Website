    "content": "<div class=\"green-text padding-top-20\"><p>SAVE focuses on some of Africa’s most iconic wildlife species – lions, cheetahs, and hyenas. They are all experiencing declining populations. These animals once roamed across nearly the entire African continent. Today, these carnivores can be found in only small pockets of their former ranges—mostly in national parks. Even in protected areas, the animals are not always safe from poaching. Outside protected area boundaries in the animals’ natural habitats they are all at risk of being shot, poisoned, and trapped by humans. SAVE is also supporting research on prey animals, such as zebra and wildebeest, to understand more about food abundance for large carnivores among other things.<br/> SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund is working to protect and recover these important predators and other African wildlife and their habitats to assure they do not go extinct.</p></div><div><p>Although the lion is one of Africa’s most iconic animals few people realize that populations of African lions have plummeted. Lions were once one of the most wide-ranging mammals in the world wandering the continents of Africa, Asia, Europe and India. Only a century ago, there were as many as 200,000 wild lions in Africa. In 2008, scientists estimated that there were fewer than 30,000. Sadly, it is now rare to hear the lion’s terrific roar across the savannah. Africa’s largest carnivore and iconic species is in jeopardy.</p><p>As human population increases in Africa so too does the ever-expanding agricultural frontier, and along with this the intense conflict between people and lions. Habitat is fragmented and lost and reserves are continually surrounded by farmland. Over hunting by humans has led to a decline in natural prey for the lions. This establishes a vicious cycle in which lions are forced to prey on livestock, further driving the conflict with humans. Few wildlife parks are large enough to ensure lion’s long-term survival. Because conflict with livestock is by far the most serious threat to large carnivores, it is critical that methods are found to integrate predator conservation with realistic livestock management.</p></div>"
